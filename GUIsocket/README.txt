New GUI utilizing C#.

*The DTWfiles folder includes changes made in main and webcam manager in an attempt to send files to the C# GUI (still a work in progress). GitHub would not let me upload the entire DTWpipe folder due to the amount of files, so the DTWfiles folder only contains main and webcam manager.

*The SeniorDesignProjectGUI3.0 folder is the C# script I have been playing around with as of recently.
