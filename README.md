## Objective 
	Compare the efficacy of various methods of computer vision in combination with machine learning as 
 	applied to signed translation tasks in real time. 
## Methods 
The following methods will be used in coordination with the MediaPipe vectorization library. The 
goal there is to be able to translate pertinent information from the image or video stream into 
usable but more spatially efficient data. The hands, in this case, are skeletonized and then 
stored as vectors to be used in a variety of ways. 
### Rule Based Recognition
